<p> Data: Final Project Pitches </p> 

<p> Kaitlyn Mitchell</p> 
=====================
<h1> Final Pitch Revision: </h1> 

<p>For my final project, I will have to scrape various sets of data from the website enigma.io, as well as NYC Open Data. To do this, I will use Excel to sort, aggregate, filter, and merge it using the Pivot Table tool.</p> 

<p>Since I wasn't terribly excited by any of the ideas I previously pitched, I have three more ideas, though I haven't yet figured out where to find all of the appropriate data sets for each.</p>

<p>The first pitch would aim to create a final project something like the Propublica Acetaminophen table, but it would compare levels of banned ingredients in common foods (ingredients that are banned in most European countries, but remain legal in the United States). This would include Ractopamine-tainted meats, flame retardant found in drinks and gum, artificial colors and dyes, arsenic, potassium bromate, olestra, the preservatives BHA nad BHT, and rGBH. The question I'm asking is: how many of these dangerous ingredients are you consuming daily without even knowing it? Human sources include local officials on food contaminents, etc.</p>

<p>The second pitch asks: Is New York as sex-positive as other major cities? This project will analyze businesses and social groups (including Babeland, Open Love New York, and the NYC Condom Campaign), and contrast the results with data from Los Angeles, Portland, Chicago, D.C., Boston, London, Berlin. Ideally, I'd love to make a map of locations of sex-positive gatherings or businesses in each city. Human sources include business owners and local activists.</p>

<p>Pitch #3: It's not widely known that the Susan G. Komen foundation is funded by giant corporations, some of which sell products that  have been found to cause cancer long-term. Susan G. Komen funds almost exclusively heredity breast cancer research, NOT environmentally-caused cancers (despite the fact that most women with breast cancer have environmentally-caused, not hereditary). This project would analyze the backers of Susan G. Komen and how political leanings might affect this organization that may not be as generous as it seems. Possible human sources include breast cancer survivors, as well as cancer researchers and their funders.</p> 

<p>For the local neighborhood pieces, I could pitch to Time Out New York, The New York Post, The New York Observer, The L Magazine, Bedford and Bowery. For the banned food ingredients and the Susan G. Komen pitch, I could try Popular Science Magazine or even Propublica.</p>
