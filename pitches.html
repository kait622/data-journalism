<p> Data: Final Project Pitches </p> 

<p> Kaitlyn Mitchell</p> 
=====================
<h1> Final Pitch Revision: </h1> 

<<<<<<< HEAD
<p> My final project will answer the question: How does New York compare to </p> 

<p>For my final project, I will have to scrape various sets of data from the website enigma.io, as well as NYC Open Data. To do this, I will use Excel to sort, aggregate, filter, and merge it using the Pivot Table tool.</p> 

<p>Since I wasn't terribly excited by any of the ideas I previously pitched, I have three more ideas, though I haven't yet figured out where to find all of the appropriate data sets for each.</p>

<p>The first pitch would aim to create a final project something like the Propublica Acetaminophen table, but it would compare levels of banned ingredients in common foods (ingredients that are banned in most European countries, but remain legal in the United States). This would include Ractopamine-tainted meats, flame retardant found in drinks and gum, artificial colors and dyes, arsenic, potassium bromate, olestra, the preservatives BHA nad BHT, and rGBH. The question I'm asking is: how many of these dangerous ingredients are you consuming daily without even knowing it? Human sources include local officials on food contaminents, etc.</p>

<p>The second pitch asks: Is New York as sex-positive as other major cities? This project will analyze businesses and social groups (including Babeland, Open Love New York, and the NYC Condom Campaign), and contrast the results with data from Los Angeles, Portland, Chicago, D.C., Boston, London, Berlin. Ideally, I'd love to make a map of locations of sex-positive gatherings or businesses in each city. Human sources include business owners and local activists.</p>

<p>For the local neighborhood pieces, I could pitch to Time Out New York, The New York Post, The New York Observer, The L Magazine, Bedford and Bowery. For the banned food ingredients pitch, I could try Popular Science Magazine or even Propublica</p>

<p>Form: Comedy is one of those areas of the arts where men still dominate by a large percentage. At a recent stand-up night at Arlene's Grocery on the LES, only one out of eight comedians was a female, and at Comedy Cellar in the village, nights featuring 10 comedians are commonly 100% male. Writers on comedy shows like Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, John Stewart, and Saturday Night Live also tend to skew male. I would like to compare female comedians in these three areas: stand-up, improv, and writing for comedy shows. The question I want answered is: in the broader context of the equal rights amendment, and the wage gap, how pervasive is the uncomfortable belief that "women can't be funny"? This pitch will compliment my 3,000-word feature piece on the status of up-and-coming female comedians in NYC that I'm doing for my capstone class, Reporting the Arts, taught by GQ editor Devin Gordon.</p>

<p>Potential data sources: What I would like to do is take the line-ups from all of the relevant big and small stand-up comedy venues (including improv like Upright Citizens' Brigade, Magnet Theater, and People's Improv Theater). This info is easy enough to obtain by looking online or contacting the venue managers/show producers. I would then put each venue's percentage of female performers into excel and sort by category.</p>

<p>Potential human sources: Comediennes Desiree Burch, Jenny Slate, Aparna Nancherla, Jena Friedman, Phoebe Robinson, Charla Lauriston, Rebecca Vigil, Liza Treyger, Kate Berlant, Amber Nelson, and the musical duo "The Reformed Whores." I could also talk to Julian Kiani at Arlene's Grocery, who has been producing comedy there for over three years.</p>

<p>What I need to learn: I will use Excel to sort, aggregate, filter, and merge my data using the Pivot Table tool.</p>

<p>To be pitched to: The New York Times Magazine, The New York Times Arts + Leisure Section, Bedford + Bowery, The Village Voice, The L Magazine, Paper Magazine, Gotham Magazine, The New York Post, DNAinfo New York, New York Magazine, Metro, Jezebel, Feministing, Bustle, Salon, Vice, Slate, Gothamist, and New York Daily News.</p>
