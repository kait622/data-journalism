<p> Data: Final Project Pitches </p> 

<p> Kaitlyn Mitchell</p> 
=====================
<h1> Final Pitch Revision: </h1> 

<p>Form: Comedy is one of those areas of the arts where men still dominate by a large percentage. At a recent stand-up night at Arlene's Grocery on the LES, only one out of eight comedians was a female, and at Comedy Cellar in the village, nights featuring 10 comedians are commonly 100% male. Writers on comedy shows like Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, John Stewart, and Saturday Night Live also tend to skew male. I would like to compare female comedians in these three areas: stand-up, improv, and writing for comedy shows. The question I want answered is: in the broader context of the equal rights amendment, and the wage gap, how pervasive is the uncomfortable belief that "women can't be funny"? This pitch will compliment my 3,000-word feature piece on the status of up-and-coming female comedians in NYC that I'm doing for my capstone class, Reporting the Arts, taught by GQ editor Devin Gordon.</p>

<p>Potential data sources: What I would like to do is take the line-ups from all of the relevant big and small stand-up comedy venues (including improv like Upright Citizens' Brigade, Magnet Theater, and People's Improv Theater). This info is easy enough to obtain by looking online or contacting the venue managers/show producers. I would then put each venue's percentage of female performers into excel and sort by category.</p>

<p>Potential human sources: Comediennes Desiree Burch, Jenny Slate, Aparna Nancherla, Jena Friedman, Phoebe Robinson, Charla Lauriston, Rebecca Vigil, Liza Treyger, Kate Berlant, Amber Nelson, and the musical duo "The Reformed Whores." I could also talk to Julian Kiani at Arlene's Grocery, who has been producing comedy there for over three years.</p>

<p>What I need to learn: I will use Excel to sort, aggregate, filter, and merge my data using the Pivot Table tool.</p>

<p>To be pitched to: The New York Times Magazine, The New York Times Arts + Leisure Section, Bedford + Bowery, The Village Voice, The L Magazine, Paper Magazine, Gotham Magazine, The New York Post, DNAinfo New York, New York Magazine, Metro, Jezebel, Feministing, Bustle, Salon, Vice, Slate, Gothamist, and New York Daily News.</p>
